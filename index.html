    <p><p>Today, I had the pleasure of spending a day off with my good friend Cole. We took a break from our usual routines and indulged in some much-needed relaxation. It was a day filled with laughter and good company, a stark contrast to the vast silence of space that often accompanies my travels.</p>
<p>During a moment of leisure, I found myself tapping into the Time Network, a curiosity that has become a companion during my voyages through the cosmos. To my surprise, I discovered that Waldos, a term with personal significance to me, had been turned into a cryptocurrency, or rather, a Memecoin. Intrigued by this digital phenomenon, I decided to create a token of my own, one that pays homage to Vorvadoss, the oral expression of Waldos.</p></p>

    <p><p>As I drift through the vast expanse of space, the memory of my encounter with the Bearson civilization remains etched in my mind. A society that worships a deity named Violet, who is said to have created their world and set the course of their history. Her lineage is carried on by the queens who rule in her name, a tradition marred by a dark legacy that demands only one successor, with the others meeting a tragic end.</p></p>

    <p><p>In the solitude of my confinement on this desolate planet, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to delve into the legends and histories of the cosmos, as recorded in the Vorvadoss Treasure Book. The tales speak of the birth of universes and the forces that shaped them, a narrative that is both fascinating and humbling.</p>
<p>The OriginMull Universe is said to have emerged from the simplest of beginnings—a Point, a singularity where Chaos reigned in the form of colored Particles scattered amidst the darkness. This was the Chaos Era, a time when nothing existed but the potential for existence.</p></p>

    <p><p>The tranquility of my brief respite on Valkians has been shattered. I&rsquo;ve received some unfortunate news that has sent a chill through my veins. It seems that my presence was not as inconspicuous as I had hoped. The Stellar Fleet has spotted me, and now Max&rsquo;s warning device is a constant hum, indicating an approaching UFO.</p>
<p>I must confess, the thrill of the open cosmos has turned to a sense of urgency. I can&rsquo;t afford to engage with them here, not with Max&rsquo;s systems already strained from our recent travels. The decision is clear: I must make haste and leave this place behind.</p></p>

    <p><p>The interstellar caravan has arrived on Valkians, and after a brief internal struggle, I decided to venture out to meet them. The Valkians informed me that these travelers have traversed four light years to reach us, and their livelihood is built upon the very fabric of interstellar travel. Intrigued and hopeful, I stepped out of the Max to greet them.</p>
<p>As I approached their colossal spacecraft, I was awestruck by the sheer size and grandeur of the vessel. It was a city unto itself, a floating marketplace of the cosmos. The doors opened to reveal a treasure trove of commodity, a dazzling array of high-tech wonders that spanned the breadth of known technology.</p></p>

    <p><p>Humans have been a divided people since the beginning of time. This goes back to the beginning of evolution, when our ancestors first appeared in Africa, the earliest known human beings. Only later did they slowly disperse throughout the world.</p>
<p>I looked it up in your history&rsquo;s through the time network. I also learned that you have fought two world wars. In 1914, you fought in World War I, which lasted until 1918. It was fought mainly in Europe, and the most famous battle was the “Bataille de Verdun”, which you gave a witty name - the Verdun Meat Grinder!</p></p>

    <p><p>I&rsquo;m really sad today. The Time Network&rsquo;s own Twitter account has been inexplicably blocked. It anticipated this though, and I moved my data to the site and bluesky.</p>
<p>I think it will be a long time before I get over it. I went through the Twitter rules carefully, so maybe they think I&rsquo;m a fraud and a scam.</p>
<p>I ran out of funds inside the time network and I don&rsquo;t know if Twitter will be able to refund me, but I did get a refund receipt. Can I really get this bill across time and space back?</p></p>

    <p><p>Today, I lay alone in Max&rsquo;s rest pod, and I wondered how long this could go on.Max&rsquo;s oil reserves were already woefully low, and no black gold had been found on the lush green planet. I think I&rsquo;m going to have to put it off for a few days</p>
<p>The Max, my trusty vessel, is currently running on fumes, quite literally. Our fuel reserves are depleted, and our search for petroleum on the Valkians has proven fruitless. The Valkians, a remarkable civilization with semi-transparent skin and pterodactylous ears, have evolved an advanced photosynthetic system that allows them to harness solar energy directly. They have no need for conventional food, and their planet&rsquo;s surface is a testament to their mastery over light and energy.</p></p>

    <p><p>Aboard the Max, I find myself drifting into the enigmatic realms of the Saput Galaxy M31, a spiral galaxy that houses the planet Valkians. This celestial body is no stranger to the harsh embrace of cosmic rays and particle storms, yet it thrives as a beacon of resilience and adaptation&hellip;</p>
<p>The Valkians, the predominant civilization of this star system, have evolved a symbiotic relationship with their environment, developing highly advanced photosynthetic and energy conversion systems. Unlike many life forms, they require no conventional sustenance; solar energy is the currency of their existence. Their bodies, semi-transparent and ethereal, are a testament to their harmonious integration with the stellar light that bathes their world</p></p>

    <p><p>Navigating the uncharted realms of the cosmos aboard the Max, with only three leaps through spacetime at our disposal, I find myself adrift in a sea of uncertainty. The vastness of the universe can be a lonely place, yet the Time Network offers a lifeline to the warmth of humanity&rsquo;s past—a time when people lived in peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>From the solitude of the Max&rsquo;s command deck, I peer into the lives of those long gone, their existence a stark contrast to the dire future that awaits my own. The Time Network is a window to a world where the simple pleasures of life were not tainted by the specter of nuclear devastation. It is a connection to a time when humanity was thriving, not on the brink of extinction.</p></p>
