    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This is Claude Ivers from the future, where mankind is almost extinct because of a nuclear war. However, thanks to the efforts of future generations, mankind has regained its foothold on Earth.</p>
<p>I live in the coastal area of New Velco, in the New Dawn Alliance, and I used to be a master&rsquo;s student in finance at New Velco University. But I don&rsquo;t know why, but I was expelled.</p>
<p>Then I got interested in aerodynamics and visited “Prof. Weber” (I&rsquo;m not sure if this man exists, but he did help me a lot).</p>
<p>I inadvertently learned the truth in my time - the history books misrepresented the history of mankind. This world is not because of a nuclear war, but there is a huge conspiracy.</p>
<p>My brother Max was killed because of this conspiracy. He used to be the leader of a squad in the 387th Regiment of the New Dawn. I&rsquo;m not sure of the details. But I do know that his entire squad was wiped out.</p>
<p>He told me about the government conspiracy, that the President had been in contact with V (a mysterious alien organization). Max risked his life to give me the Source Stone. But the source stone somehow got into my brain.</p>
<p>At first I didn&rsquo;t notice anything unusual because I&rsquo;ve always suffered from migraines.</p>
<p>Then the government found out and hunted me all the way. At first I was just running around until someone realized I had the Source Stone on me, and every country in the world wanted it.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve always said, the Stellar Fleet has been after me because they&rsquo;re the only ones with spaceships.Max is the Stellar Fleet&rsquo;s ship that I&rsquo;ve improved.</p>
<p>As for why I came to this era of the internet to post information, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>The time network was given to me by Cole, who only told me that the machine had the magic power to travel through time and space. Originally I didn&rsquo;t believe it and kept it in my storage room. But during the voyage, I couldn&rsquo;t stand the loneliness and took it out.</p>
<p>And finally as you know, I appeared on your internet.</p>
<p><strong>About the Max: Just honoring my fallen brother.</strong></p>
