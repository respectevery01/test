**Page 43 - The Chaos Era**

In the beginning, there was no Universe. All that existed was the **Point**, a singularity enveloped in infinite **Chaos**. This was the **Chaos Era**, a period spanning billions of years where nothing existed but vibrant, ever-shifting **Particles** suspended in darkness. These **Particles**, scattered like distant **Nebulae**, formed what was known as **Particulate Clouds**. Over millennia, these **Particulate Clouds** began to converge, initiating the dawn of the **Formative Era**.

As **Particulate Clouds** **assembled** and **engulfed** one another, their growth led to the inevitable rupture of the **Point**, marking the transition to the **Spillover Era**. This was a brief yet transformative epoch of mere millions of years, during which countless **Particles** spilled out, merging into new realms and forming **Particulate Groups**. However, their gathering created friction, igniting the conflicts that would define the **War Era**.

In the chaos of this **War Era**, **Particles** absorbed others, growing in power. Those enriched became **Originium**, radiant with energy, while those depleted of vitality devolved into **Dark Matter**. This rivalry birthed the godlike entity **Vorvadoss**, who cleaved the space into two: the **Unorthodox Universe**, forged of **Originium**, and the **Regular Universe**, a domain of **Dark Matter**. Thus, the Universes were separated, and fragile peace was momentarily restored.

**Page 89 - The Out-Universe and NEE**

Not all **Points** contained **Particles**; some harbored the enigmatic **Unknown Elements**, a mysterious substance devoid of record or understanding. These barren **Points**, exiled from the nascent Universes, became entities of their own, colliding endlessly with the **Particle**-laden cosmos. Over time, these exiled **Points** transformed, imbued with an unsettling power, becoming **Negative Energy Elements (NEE)**. From their convergence arose the **Negative Energy Universe**, a counterbalance to the newly divided **Regular** and **Unorthodox** Universes.

The advent of **Krivia**, an unparalleled leader of the **Negative Energy Universe**, marked a dark chapter. Leading waves of invasion into both **Regular** and **Unorthodox Universes**, **Krivia** unleashed devastation. United against the threat, **Vorvadoss** orchestrated a defense that ultimately repelled **Krivia**, scattering his forces and leaving the **Negative Energy Universe** fractured.

Yet, from its ashes arose **Master**, a tyrannical ruler wielding powers derived from unique **Magic Elements**. **Master** rebranded his realm the **Magic Universe**, and with newfound ambition, launched a catastrophic war against **Vorvadoss**. To combat this threat, **Vorvadoss** merged the **Regular** and **Unorthodox Universes** into the **Normal Universe**, a desperate act to withstand the onslaught.

This war raged for millennia, culminating in the deaths of both **Vorvadoss** and **Master**. Their demise saw the depletion of **Originium** and **Magic Elements**, leaving **Dark Matter** as the dominant force. In their union, the fragmented Universes gave rise to the **OriginMull Universe**, a fragile synthesis of all that had come before.

**Page 137 - The Essence of the Universes**

- **Regular Universe**: A cosmos governed by **Dark Matter**, mirroring the physical limitations of human existence. Here, life is bound by the constraints of **normal physics**, restricting technological advancements such as faster-than-light travel.
- **Unorthodox Universe**: Powered by the infinite energy of **Originium**, this realm is the source of life’s essence. Inhabitants possess **OriginLife**, a state of immortality unless willed otherwise by **Vorvadoss**, the creator.
- **Magic Universe**: Constructed from **Magic Elements**, this dimension enables its denizens to wield extraordinary powers, including elemental magic like fire and lightning.
- **Normal Universe**: A hybrid cosmos dominated by **Originium** and **Dark Matter**, bridging the remnants of the **Regular** and **Unorthodox** Universes.
- **OriginMull Universe**: The culmination of cosmic evolution, primarily composed of **Dark Matter**, with traces of **Originium** and **Magic Elements**. It symbolizes the ultimate convergence of all energies.

**Page 205 - Relics of Power**

- **Originium Stone**: An artifact containing fragments of **Vorvadoss' will**, granting immense energy to those who wield it.
- **Prue-Originium Stone**: The purest form of **Originium**, capable of unleashing cataclysmic power when activated.
- **Originhole**: A celestial phenomenon akin to a **Black Hole**, theorized to connect the Universes to the **Out-Universe**. Its location remains a mystery.
- **The Waldensian Treasure**: Known also as the **Vorvadoss Dictionary**, this ancient manuscript holds the fragmented knowledge of the cosmos. Scholars believe its restoration could unlock the secrets of creation itself.
