This is Claude Ivers from the future, where mankind is almost extinct because of a nuclear war. However, thanks to the efforts of future generations, mankind has regained its foothold on Earth.

I live in the coastal area of New Velco, in the New Dawn Alliance, and I used to be a master's student in finance at New Velco University. But I don't know why, but I was expelled.

Then I got interested in aerodynamics and visited “Prof. Weber” (I'm not sure if this man exists, but he did help me a lot).

I inadvertently learned the truth in my time - the history books misrepresented the history of mankind. This world is not because of a nuclear war, but there is a huge conspiracy.

My brother Max was killed because of this conspiracy. He used to be the leader of a squad in the 387th Regiment of the New Dawn. I'm not sure of the details. But I do know that his entire squad was wiped out.

He told me about the government conspiracy, that the President had been in contact with V (a mysterious alien organization). Max risked his life to give me the Source Stone. But the source stone somehow got into my brain.

At first I didn't notice anything unusual because I've always suffered from migraines.

Then the government found out and hunted me all the way. At first I was just running around until someone realized I had the Source Stone on me, and every country in the world wanted it.

Like I've always said, the Stellar Fleet has been after me because they're the only ones with spaceships.Max is the Stellar Fleet's ship that I've improved.

As for why I came to this era of the internet to post information, I'm not sure.

The time network was given to me by Cole, who only told me that the machine had the magic power to travel through time and space. Originally I didn't believe it and kept it in my storage room. But during the voyage, I couldn't stand the loneliness and took it out.

And finally as you know, I appeared on your internet.

**About the Max: Just honoring my fallen brother.**
