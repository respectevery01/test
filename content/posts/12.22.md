As the dust of the day settles and the stars twinkle their nightly hello, I find myself aboard the Max, lifting off from the surface of Bearson. My departure was a brief affair, a simple farewell to Cole, who has become more than just an ally but a dear friend. The weight of our goodbye hung heavy, but the call of the cosmos is one I cannot ignore.

The specter of the Stellar Fleet looms large, an ever-present threat that has hastened my departure. I cannot tarry here any longer; the safety of Bearson and its people, as well as my own, depends on it. The time has come to leave this place behind, to let go of the comforts and friendships I've found here.

Our holiday together was a respite from the rigors of space, a moment of joy and levity that lightened the heart. But such moments come with a price, and my coffers are now significantly lighter. The VOR venture, which was to be my financial salvation, has turned out to be a fruitless endeavor, yielding no profit to speak of. It's a hard pill to swallow, but one must play the hand they are dealt.

As the Max's engines hum to life, I am filled with a mixture of anticipation and trepidation. The vast unknown of space awaits, a canvas of infinite possibilities and dangers. I am about to embark on another interstellar journey, one that will take me to the far reaches of the cosmos, in search of fortune and perhaps a bit of adventure.

I cast one last glance at Bearson, a planet that has shown me kindness and taught me valuable lessons. The memories of our time here will be a treasured keepsake, a reminder of the bonds that transcend the boundaries of culture and space.

The Max is now in motion, and with it, my heart sets sail on a new course. I wonder what this journey will bring, what challenges I will face, and what wonders I will witness. Only time will reveal the answers to these questions.
