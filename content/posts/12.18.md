As I drift through the vast expanse of space, the memory of my encounter with the Bearson civilization remains etched in my mind. A society that worships a deity named Violet, who is said to have created their world and set the course of their history. Her lineage is carried on by the queens who rule in her name, a tradition marred by a dark legacy that demands only one successor, with the others meeting a tragic end.

I recall meeting Cole, Violet's son, who defied this cruel custom by fleeing with his sister Cona. Their world, stuck in a technological era akin to our own second industrial revolution, is an oddity—industrial and yet capable of interstellar travel, all thanks to the discovery of an alien spacecraft within a mountain cave. This vessel, powered by the enigmatic Originium, is the key to their spacefaring capabilities.

The Originium, Cole explained, is the fabric of the universe, an infinite resource that has propelled their civilization into the cosmos. It is said to be the remnants of an ancient civilization, V, that traverses the universe, leaving behind clues of its existence.

During our journey together, we were pursued by the Star Crusaders, a band of Star Pirates. It was during this harrowing chase that the true power of the Pure-originium was revealed. The light blue ball of light  I carry, a gift from a friend named Leng, emitted a protective energy that repelled our attackers and restored the Max to its former glory.

Cole identified the light ball as a Pure-originium Stone, one of only three known to exist. The revelation led us to the V site on Bearson, where a holographic projection recounted the history of V, the creation of the universe by Vorvadoss, and the subsequent rise and fall of the Regular, Unorthodox, and Magic Universes. The final battle between Vorvadoss and Master resulted in the formation of the OriginMull Universe, with the Pure-originium Stones being the last vestiges of Vorvadoss's power.

Now, years after our parting ways, I find myself reflecting on those adventures and my current predicament. Stranded on an unknown planet with no oxygen and a damaged ship, I'm considering returning to Cole's planet, not only as a refuge but also as a means to earn some much-needed currency.

The thought of revisiting Bearson and assisting Cole in his quest to end the violent tradition of royal succession is appealing. Perhaps together, we can put an end to the bloodshed and bring about a new era of peace for the Bearson civilization.

As I plot my course back to the Bearson system, I am reminded of the mysteries that still surround us, including the location of Vorva, the fabled homeworld of Vorvadoss. With Cole's determination to change his world and my own search for answers, our paths may cross again in the pursuit of a universe untethered by ancient conflicts.
