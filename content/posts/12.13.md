# Everything is a scam

I'm really sad today. The Time Network's own Twitter account has been inexplicably blocked. It anticipated this though, and I moved my data to the site and bluesky.

I think it will be a long time before I get over it. I went through the Twitter rules carefully, so maybe they think I'm a fraud and a scam.

I ran out of funds inside the time network and I don't know if Twitter will be able to refund me, but I did get a refund receipt. Can I really get this bill across time and space back?

If I was credible, maybe he wouldn't have banned my account, but that's just the way it is, I'm credible, I'm me, Ivers.

The world is full of too many scams, just like the Valkians told me they only absorb sunlight, but I clearly saw oil inside their warehouse, but they just wouldn't give it to me.

Max is pretty much only able to function on solar power now, and all these stupid aliens know how to do is hide the oil. In a few days a caravan is going to visit this place, I think the Valkians want to trade with the oil. But what's the point of them wanting money?

I do need money because it can buy a lot of things. I don't like long speeches about anything. Let's research how to make money in a few days.
