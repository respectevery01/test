My dear blog readers,

It has been a few days since my last entry, and I must apologize for the silence. The past few days have been a blur of aimless navigation through the vast expanse of space. As of today, there has been no sign of a life-bearing planet, only the unending silence of the cosmos. It's a solitude that can be both peaceful and unnerving, a stark reminder of how small we are in the grand scheme of the universe.

On the brighter side, the Max's fuel reserves are holding out, providing us with the means to continue our journey. The ship's hum is a comforting constant, a reassurance that we can press on into the unknown.

During these long hours of solitude, my thoughts have turned to the VOR project. The journey of VOR has been as tumultuous as my travels through space, with its own set of challenges and uncertainties. But just as I have faith in the Max to carry me through the void, I have faith in VOR to find its course.

I am reflecting on the direction we should take, the strategies we can employ to steer VOR towards success. It's a work in progress, much like the path ahead of us in the stars. There will be setbacks, I'm sure, but there will also be moments of triumph.

As I sit here in the cockpit of the Max, the stars streaking by outside, I am filled with a sense of determination. We will find our way, just as we always have. The universe may be vast and indifferent, but it also offers endless opportunities for those willing to venture into the unknown.

So, to my readers, I say this: hold fast to your beliefs, even in the face of adversity. Just as my journey through space is a series of ups and downs, so too is the journey of any endeavor worth undertaking.

The Max is ready, and so am I. We may not know what lies ahead, but we are prepared to meet it head-on.

â€” Claude Ivers sails on the edge of the universe.
