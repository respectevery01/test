The tranquility of my brief respite on Valkians has been shattered. I've received some unfortunate news that has sent a chill through my veins. It seems that my presence was not as inconspicuous as I had hoped. The Stellar Fleet has spotted me, and now Max's warning device is a constant hum, indicating an approaching UFO.

I must confess, the thrill of the open cosmos has turned to a sense of urgency. I can't afford to engage with them here, not with Max's systems already strained from our recent travels. The decision is clear: I must make haste and leave this place behind.

As I pilot the Max away from Valkians, the stress of the situation is palpable. The UFO is closing in, and I'm forced to push the Max to its limits, hoping against hope that we can outrun our pursuers.

[The journal entry is cut short here, with the next part written in a hastier hand.]

I've returned to the journal under dire circumstances. Max's engine systems have failed us, and we've been forced to make a desperate landing on an unknown, desolate planet. The Stellar Fleet was closing in, but we managed to evade them at the last moment, disappearing into the cosmic void.

Now, as I find myself on this unknown world, a new danger presents itself. The environment is inhospitable, with no oxygen to sustain life. My situation is dire, and I must act quickly to secure a means of survival.

I'm taking measures to seal off the Max's cabin and ration what little oxygen we have. I'm also attempting to repair the engine systems, hoping to get us back into the black void of space where we belong.

For now, the journal must wait. I have work to do if I'm to see another day in this unforgiving universe.

â€” Claude Ivers, stranded on an unknown planet, fighting for survival.
