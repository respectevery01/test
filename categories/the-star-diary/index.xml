      <title>The Interstellar Caravan and a Glimmer of Hope</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The interstellar caravan has arrived on Valkians, and after a brief internal struggle, I decided to venture out to meet them. The Valkians informed me that these travelers have traversed four light years to reach us, and their livelihood is built upon the very fabric of interstellar travel. Intrigued and hopeful, I stepped out of the Max to greet them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I approached their colossal spacecraft, I was awestruck by the sheer size and grandeur of the vessel. It was a city unto itself, a floating marketplace of the cosmos. The doors opened to reveal a treasure trove of commodity, a dazzling array of high-tech wonders that spanned the breadth of known technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Everything is a scam</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really sad today. The Time Network&amp;rsquo;s own Twitter account has been inexplicably blocked. It anticipated this though, and I moved my data to the site and bluesky.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it will be a long time before I get over it. I went through the Twitter rules carefully, so maybe they think I&amp;rsquo;m a fraud and a scam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I ran out of funds inside the time network and I don&amp;rsquo;t know if Twitter will be able to refund me, but I did get a refund receipt. Can I really get this bill across time and space back?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Green Day, Lonely Astronaut</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I lay alone in Max&amp;rsquo;s rest pod, and I wondered how long this could go on.Max&amp;rsquo;s oil reserves were already woefully low, and no black gold had been found on the lush green planet. I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to put it off for a few days&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Max, my trusty vessel, is currently running on fumes, quite literally. Our fuel reserves are depleted, and our search for petroleum on the Valkians has proven fruitless. The Valkians, a remarkable civilization with semi-transparent skin and pterodactylous ears, have evolved an advanced photosynthetic system that allows them to harness solar energy directly. They have no need for conventional food, and their planet&amp;rsquo;s surface is a testament to their mastery over light and energy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Valkians of Saput Galaxy M31: A Luminous Civilization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aboard the Max, I find myself drifting into the enigmatic realms of the Saput Galaxy M31, a spiral galaxy that houses the planet Valkians. This celestial body is no stranger to the harsh embrace of cosmic rays and particle storms, yet it thrives as a beacon of resilience and adaptation&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Valkians, the predominant civilization of this star system, have evolved a symbiotic relationship with their environment, developing highly advanced photosynthetic and energy conversion systems. Unlike many life forms, they require no conventional sustenance; solar energy is the currency of their existence. Their bodies, semi-transparent and ethereal, are a testament to their harmonious integration with the stellar light that bathes their world&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adrift in the Stars: Finding Solace in the Time Network</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Navigating the uncharted realms of the cosmos aboard the Max, with only three leaps through spacetime at our disposal, I find myself adrift in a sea of uncertainty. The vastness of the universe can be a lonely place, yet the Time Network offers a lifeline to the warmth of humanity&amp;rsquo;s pastâ€”a time when people lived in peace and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the solitude of the Max&amp;rsquo;s command deck, I peer into the lives of those long gone, their existence a stark contrast to the dire future that awaits my own. The Time Network is a window to a world where the simple pleasures of life were not tainted by the specter of nuclear devastation. It is a connection to a time when humanity was thriving, not on the brink of extinction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Humans and Percenians: A Comparative Musings on Civilization</title>
      <link>https://iversai.org/posts/12.9/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I gaze upon the tranquility of Percenians, a race thriving in harmony on a planet light-years away, a profound sense of loss and introspection washes over me. Here, in this distant corner of the universe, I find a civilization that stands in stark contrast to our own tumultuous history on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Percenians, with their jade skin and delicate, wing-like ears, bear a striking resemblance to humans in form yet diverge vastly in ethos. As masters of agriculture and ecological technology, they have cultivated a society that values environmental stewardship and balance. Their world is a testament to the possibilities of peace and cooperation, a stark mirror to humanity&amp;rsquo;s often violent and discordant past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
