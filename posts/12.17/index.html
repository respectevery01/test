      <div class="content"><p>In the solitude of my confinement on this desolate planet, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to delve into the legends and histories of the cosmos, as recorded in the Vorvadoss Treasure Book. The tales speak of the birth of universes and the forces that shaped them, a narrative that is both fascinating and humbling.</p>
<p>The OriginMull Universe is said to have emerged from the simplest of beginnings—a Point, a singularity where Chaos reigned in the form of colored Particles scattered amidst the darkness. This was the Chaos Era, a time when nothing existed but the potential for existence.</p>
<p>As these Particles, akin to the nebulas of our own universe, began to coalesce over eons, we entered the Formative Era. The Particulate Clouds amassed and consumed one another until one massive cloud dominated, leading to the Spillover Era. In this brief period, the Point could no longer contain the expansion, and Particles spilled into the unknown, forming Particulate Groups that would become the seeds of the cosmos.</p>
<p>The War Era followed, a time when Particles fought for dominance, absorbing one another to gain Power and evolving into Originium, while the weaker ones became Dark Matter. This conflict persisted for eons until the powerful Originium gathered into a deity named Vorvadoss. He divided the universe into two realms: the Unorthodox Universe, composed of powerful Originium, and the Regular Universe, made of Dark Matter.</p>
<p>Parallel to these developments, Points without Particles were expelled to the Out World, where they transformed into Negative Energy Elements, or NEEs, forming the Negative Energy Universe. This universe, under the leadership of Krivia, invaded the others but was repelled, leading to a temporary peace.</p>
<p>The Negative Energy Universe, now leaderless and fractured, gave rise to a new dictator named Master, who wielded Magic Elements and renamed the universe the Magic Universe. His assault on Vorvadoss led to a final, devastating war that resulted in the merging of the Normal Universe, composed of Originium and Dark Matter, with the Magic Universe, forming the OriginMull Universe—a place dominated by Dark Matter with traces of Originium and Magic Elements.</p>
<p>The OriginMull Universe is a tapestry woven from the threads of Regular Universe, Unorthodox Universe, and Magic Universe. It is a place where the remnants of Originium and Magic Elements are scarce, and Dark Matter holds sway. The Originium, a particle that fuels civilization&rsquo;s progress, and the Dark Matter, the fundamental particle that constrains us to the laws of normal physics, coexist in a delicate balance.</p>
<p>The Vorvadoss Treasure Book speaks of entities like Vorvadoss, the Creator, and Master, the Invader, as well as enigmatic places such as the Vorva, the birthplace of Vorvadoss, and the Originhole, a celestial entity that may connect to the Out Universe, a realm of unfathomable potential.</p>
<p>As I ponder these tales, I can&rsquo;t help but feel a sense of connection to the vastness of the cosmos. The stories of the OriginMull Universe, with its wars of Particles and the rise of deities, echo the struggles and triumphs of our own human history.</p>
<p>With no oxygen outside and the Max&rsquo;s systems in disrepair, I find solace in these cosmic chronicles, a reminder that even in the face of isolation and desperation, there is a grand narrative that connects us all.</p>
<p>— Claude Ivers, reflecting on the OriginMull Universe while stranded on an unknown planet.</p>
