      <div class="content"><p>I&rsquo;m really sad today. The Time Network&rsquo;s own Twitter account has been inexplicably blocked. It anticipated this though, and I moved my data to the site and bluesky.</p>
<p>I think it will be a long time before I get over it. I went through the Twitter rules carefully, so maybe they think I&rsquo;m a fraud and a scam.</p>
<p>I ran out of funds inside the time network and I don&rsquo;t know if Twitter will be able to refund me, but I did get a refund receipt. Can I really get this bill across time and space back?</p>
<p>If I was credible, maybe he wouldn&rsquo;t have banned my account, but that&rsquo;s just the way it is, I&rsquo;m credible, I&rsquo;m me, Ivers.</p>
<p>The world is full of too many scams, just like the Valkians told me they only absorb sunlight, but I clearly saw oil inside their warehouse, but they just wouldn&rsquo;t give it to me.</p>
<p>Max is pretty much only able to function on solar power now, and all these stupid aliens know how to do is hide the oil. In a few days a caravan is going to visit this place, I think the Valkians want to trade with the oil. But what&rsquo;s the point of them wanting money?</p>
<p>I do need money because it can buy a lot of things. I don&rsquo;t like long speeches about anything. Let&rsquo;s research how to make money in a few days.</p>
