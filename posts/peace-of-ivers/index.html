      <div class="content"><p>Humans have been a divided people since the beginning of time. This goes back to the beginning of evolution, when our ancestors first appeared in Africa, the earliest known human beings. Only later did they slowly disperse throughout the world.</p>
<p>I looked it up in your history&rsquo;s through the time network. I also learned that you have fought two world wars. In 1914, you fought in World War I, which lasted until 1918. It was fought mainly in Europe, and the most famous battle was the “Bataille de Verdun”, which you gave a witty name - the Verdun Meat Grinder!</p>
<p>Of course, I lived in a time when wars were frequent and on a much larger scale than yours. My history books tell me that mankind drew the wrath of the heavens (probably V&rsquo;s retribution) for over-extracting resources.</p>
<p>The Earth I live on also has a South Pole and a North Pole like yours. But they have been mined out by humans. In the last century, human beings over-exploited oil. Until the rest of the world was emptied except for the two poles, where the oil was not extracted. For this reason, the United Nations established the Antarctic Petroleum Consortium and the Arctic Petroleum Consortium.</p>
<p>Although they were established by the United Nations organization, they still have the shadow of big countries behind them. (Our UN is not like your UN, it&rsquo;s a union of independent wills, similar to your EU)</p>
<p>Frank Lee is the president of United Antarctic Petroleum and has been advocating that oil will be available for at least another 30 years.</p>
<p>His move caused the company&rsquo;s stock price to skyrocket. That is, until a voice of discord emerges from within the company. I&rsquo;m not sure what exactly, but in any case the news exposed his lies.</p>
<p>Mankind was plunged into a time of peril when there was no oil left to use. But the good news is that the government is already working on other clean energy sources.</p>
<p>But the sudden appearance of a man causes the disillusionment. He may be the key person connected to V (a series of testimonies published under the nickname V on the world&rsquo;s largest forum).</p>
<p>And finally the world is destroyed. What exactly is the reason for this I do not yet know. It&rsquo;s all in the history books. I&rsquo;ve never believed in the history books though, and think it&rsquo;s long since been tampered with by the government.</p>
<p>This is why I say mankind never learns to unite, it is always divided. They only look out for their own interests.</p>
<p>Peace is short lived in my opinion. My return here through the time network was probably a ruse by the V as well. They are a higher being, for humans.</p>
<p>Even though this device was given to me by Cole, it doesn&rsquo;t make my suspicions any less.</p>
<p>Your world is growing fast, but it has many problems. Like the wars in the Middle East, the Russo-Ukrainian war (I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m calling it accurately.)</p>
<p>Of course, I also see a very good side to you guys, you are good at learning from the past and thus making progress.</p>
<p><strong>In short, peace of ivers</strong></p>
<p>Humanity needs peace and deserves it.</p>
